# Kichn

Kichn is a kitchen inventory tracker and grocery list webapp. This is a school project.

## Setting up

On a Mac, install all software dependencies with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```
$ brew tap redis-stack/redis-stack
$ brew install redis-stack-server meilisearch zbar
```

And install all the Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Run all commands from the project root folder (`cd` into the project root folder first).

To run the web server:

```
$ python3 src/server/main.py
```

This also starts the Redis and Meilisearch servers.

Once `main.py` is running, you can run the FairPrice API scraper:

```
$ python3 src/server/scraper.py
```
